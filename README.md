# finesst-data

finesst.txt is a tab-separated csv file containing the publicly released finesst/nessf selection data.

header is: year, type, principal investigator, future investigator, institution

the first several lines were imported incorrectly and contain title information in place of the institution. i don't care enough to fix it right now.
