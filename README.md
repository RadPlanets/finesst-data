# finesst-data

finesst.txt is a tab-separated csv file containing the publicly released finesst/nessf selection data (columns: year, type, principal investigator, future investigator, institution). several lines were imported incorrectly and contain title information in place of the institution. i don't care enough to fix it right now.

i've also included the original text files, if anyone more skilled at data entry wants to use them :)
